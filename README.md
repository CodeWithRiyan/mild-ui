# mild-ui

A UI component library inspired by shadcn/ui that offers high-quality, accessible components with a focus on simplicity, customizability, and developer experience. Unlike traditional component libraries installed as npm packages, mild-ui follows the "copy and paste" approach, allowing developers to bring components directly into their projects and customize them as needed.

## Features

- **React Components**: High-quality React UI components
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt components to your project's design system
- **Copy and Paste**: No complex dependencies, just copy the components you need
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support for better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Beautiful styling with Tailwind CSS

## Philosophy

- **Mild, not wild**: Components have a clean, minimal aesthetic that's easy to customize
- **Developer-first**: Prioritizing developer experience with clear documentation and easy implementation
- **Copy, not install**: Components are copied directly into projects rather than installed as dependencies
- **Customizable**: All components can be easily customized with minimal effort
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind from the start

## Usage

### CLI Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g mild-ui

# Add components to your project
