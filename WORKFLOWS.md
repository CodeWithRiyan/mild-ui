# GitHub Workflows Status

## ✅ All Workflows Updated and Validated

The GitHub Actions workflows have been updated to work with the new package structure where:
- **Core package**: CSS/SCSS design system only (no TypeScript)
- **React/Vue packages**: Self-contained with their own types and utilities

## 🔧 Updated Workflows

### 1. **Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Status**: ✅ Updated and tested
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated core build step to reflect CSS-only nature
  - Added test execution for React/Vue packages
  - Matrix strategy tests both React and Vue frameworks
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`dev`, PRs to `main`

### 2. **Publish Workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
- **Status**: ✅ Updated and tested
- **Changes**:
  - Added comment about core being CSS-only
  - Maintained existing publish logic for all packages
  - Smart duplicate detection and skipping
- **Triggers**: Releases and manual dispatch

### 3. **Storybook Workflow** (`.github/workflows/storybook.yml`)
- **Status**: ✅ Updated and tested
- **Changes**:
  - Updated core docs generation to handle CSS-only package
  - Modified documentation links to reflect new structure
  - Updated HTML template to show correct package information
  - Builds React/Vue Storybooks + deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`, manual dispatch

## 🧪 Validation Results

All workflows have been validated with a comprehensive test script:

```bash
pnpm validate:workflows
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Build Tests: 4/4 passed
- ✅ Export Checks: 3/3 passed  
- ✅ Workflow Files: 3/3 found

## 📦 Package Build Status

| Package | Build Status | Dependencies | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `@mild-ui/core` | ✅ CSS-only | None | Design system, utilities |
| `@mild-ui/react` | ✅ Self-contained | clsx, tailwind-merge | React components |
| `@mild-ui/vue` | ✅ Self-contained | clsx, tailwind-merge | Vue components |

## 🚀 Workflow Execution

The workflows will now:

1. **Test Workflow**: Build core CSS → Build React/Vue → Run tests
2. **Publish Workflow**: Build all packages → Check versions → Publish to npm
3. **Storybook Workflow**: Build packages → Generate docs → Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 🔍 Quick Validation

To verify everything works locally:

```bash
# Test core build (CSS/SCSS only)
pnpm --filter @mild-ui/core build

# Test React build (with local types)
pnpm --filter @mild-ui/react build

# Test Vue build (with local types)
pnpm --filter @mild-ui/vue build

# Test all packages together
pnpm build

# Validate workflows
pnpm validate:workflows
```
