# Welcome to mild-ui React

mild-ui is a cross-framework UI component library inspired by the copy-paste approach of shadcn/ui, extended to work across React, Vue, and Svelte.

## Getting Started

Components are designed to be copied into your project rather than imported as dependencies. Use our CLI tool to add components:

```bash
# Install the CLI globally
npm install -g @mild-ui/cli

# Add components to your project
mild-ui add button
mild-ui add button --framework=react
```

## Features

- **Cross-framework compatibility**: Works with React, Vue, and Svelte
- **Framework-agnostic core**: Consistent design and behavior
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern utility-first styling
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support
- **Customizable**: Easy theming and customization

## Available Components

- **Button**: Primary, secondary, outline, and ghost variants with icon support
- **Input**: Text input with validation states
- **Checkbox**: Checkbox with indeterminate state support
- **Radio**: Radio buttons and radio groups
- **Select**: Dropdown select with search and multi-select
